#About jQuery Bing Maps

= jQuery Bing Maps =

The jQuery Bing Maps plugin aims at making maps on the web or mobile devices easier to set up and use. JQuery Bing Maps share both the jQuery Google Maps plugin structure and the methods.

== Why Bing Maps? ==

Usually, people have only heard of Google Maps, But if you are a keen facebook user you most likely have seen and interacted with their Bing maps events implementation. 
There are alot of differences between Bing Maps and Google Maps, first one being the functions available - Google Maps have some features Bing Maps doesn't have such as Fusion Tables, Distance Matrix, Elevation, Street view or Google Places whilst Bing Maps has Bird view (3D), Venues (e.g. stores inside a mall), and breadcrumb. 
The second one is the user interface: Google provides a set of methods to style the map itself, e.g. show/hide highways, which is great for usability. Bing maps takes on another way of dealing with usability, mainly keeping it minimalistic and clean from the get go, gradually changing the granularity of the map depending on the users zoom. While Google's map objects have no CSS classes Bing maps does, making it easier to style elements with CSS rather than have to extend the framework. 

Depending on what sort of implementation you are doing you need to consider which mapping framework suits best; what platform are you targeting? what functions do you need?. For a mobile device you would need a responsive map with minimal kB loaded. Bing maps and Google maps framework is about the same size in kB, but the images loaded are, by default, about 200% bigger in size for Google maps, making a slightly higher load time.
